# Console Tic-Tac-Toe
I wrote a console command line version of Tic Tac Toe.
The game always starts off as you are X, and then you play against the AI.

Upon a new game, you switch sides and play O and so on and so forth.

The AI is using alpha-beta pruning for it's minimax tree.

To run the game, clone this repo, and then run:
  ruby game.rb

## Purpose of this game
* Learning Ruby
* Learning basic AI and game theory
